Each Test suite tries to get available database and blocks it for running tests.
We can provide blocking marker into remote test-env. It can be an util database or table in the
tasted database for example.
Each test suite checks for available database and blocks it and releases it after tests.

Proc:
It doesn't matter where the tests run (on one env or different).

Cons:
Testing can finish no correct and remote resource doesn't be released. Problem can be resolved partly by adding timeout for blocking.
